# Topics & Weekly Classes

**The TA are advising to group learning activities** into topics rather than weeks. Now this could be a challenge if you already have a weekly delivery and grouping activities into topics that cover a number of weeks maybe a lot of work as we have very little time. It may already be the case that you may spend to a few weeks on certain topics if so structure your weekly learning activities to reflect this if possible.

**For code modules** that have much of the learning activities on a separate server or GitHub - We need to wrap a narrative around those learning activities using content/
introductions such as explainer videos on Panopto that then link to those weekly topics on the separate server. You must make sure you fill out information on your
SOL donâ€™t leave your SOL blank apart from the assessment details and rely on all the material on the external host.

**Make sure all your content is annotated,** aim to have your learning activities self explanatory, so if a student missed the class they would be able to catch up with all the learning activities without having to ask for more information. If content is clearly presented with a good narrative linking all the learning activities this will help
us were our courses have been franchised and will enable external tutors to deliver these modules without asking us lots of questions about the delivery and will also
help tutors who will take over the module in the future.

**Lead by example,** if you have links to external content which is not your own, make sure it is credited, cited and referenced correctly ideally in the Harvard style. We
should be curating, discussing and synthesising external sources/content. As we do not want to appear that we have not created any content ourselves, but just linked to lots of external resources (This may not be the case for external content such as Cisco etc.)

Make sure also that you have the rights and copyright clearance to use external content, as mentioned above this is important with the franchise partners as it may
appear that we are selling on content that we may not own have the rights to in the first place.

## Activity Design (class/topic) TA suggested coverage

### Welcome and introduction
Introduce the topic, the learning outcomes and how the
integrated process builds upon previous learning, e.g. supported by a short video.
Explain what tasks students will be required to undertake, and what is expected of them, e.g. interactive presentation, video etc.

### Knowledge acquisition
Provide engaging knowledge acquisition opportunities, e.g.
show a pre-recorded short lecture, follow links to interactive presentations or e-journals etc.

### Interactive and engaging activity
Provide a range of interactive and engaging activities that allow for differentiated learning and exploration, e.g. quizzes, H5P, students
preparing webinar presentations, or producing podcasts, blogs, vlogs etc.

### Collaboration
Build collaborative engagement into the process to build a learning community and sense of belonging, e.g. collaborative group work, use of forums etc.

Formative feedback Describe how formative assessment will take place

### Build deeper learning
Schedule regular interactive feedback sessions with students, e.g. one to one, small group etc.

### Reflect
Include opportunities for students to reflect and monitor their own progress
as they learn. 

## Guidance Leaflet

The SOL for COM302 was submitted to the Transformation Academy to be checked and signed off for both the build a topic and build a module which were created within the TA guidelines. 

The theory is once a pilot SOL has been signed off it will be used as an exemplar to build all of the SOLs across the computing subject group to make sure all mine content is consistent, although there is flexibility on layout as long as we have the requested TA content.
